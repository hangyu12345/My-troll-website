      <h4>My programming Journey</h4>
      <p>I started programming cause I wanted to build something to meaningful that will one day impress other people.
      My programming journey started when I was 14 years ols. I watched the movies called the <em><strong>The Internship</strong></em>
      and <em><strong>The Social Network</strong></em>.Both movies really inspired <strong>me and a bunch of other programming prodigies</strong> to get into the field of programming.
      We wanted to build something that will one day impact the world. So i started searching up courses on Udemy to start learning c++ and my parents paid a hefty amount of money to let me attend an in-person course to learn python.
    But shortly after that i got tired of c++ as i did not know what to do with the language so <em><strong>I started with html</strong></em> and from there my programming journey progressed.</p>
